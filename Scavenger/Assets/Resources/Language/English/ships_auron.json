The Gallant is a cruiser sized specialist that offers powerful bonuses to cooldown recovery, subunits, projectile speed, projectile range, and a very powerful bonus to effect durations. The Gallant is a low hull cruiser, but it makes up for this weakness in low delays before repairing, and having continuously regenerating shields."
